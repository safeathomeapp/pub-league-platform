# 13 Pricing, Go-To-Market, and ROI (UK-first)
Generated: 2026-02-12

## Pricing goals
- Fair for small leagues.
- Predictable for organisers.
- Low churn (annual billing aligned to seasons).
- Allows expansion via add-ons later.

## Recommended pricing (annual)
- Tier 1 (≤10 active teams): £149/year
- Tier 2 (11–30 active teams): £349/year
- Tier 3 (31–70 active teams): £649/year
- 71+ teams: custom

Rationale:
- Organisers prefer one invoice rather than per-player microbilling.
- Cost scales with admin workload and infrastructure use.

## Messaging cost handling (MVP)
Messaging creates variable cost. Options:
A) Include a fair-use quota in each tier, then charge overage.
B) Pass-through: organiser funds message credits.

Recommendation:
- MVP: include small fair-use quota (e.g., 200 messages/month) then soft-limit and warn.
- Phase 2: add message credit top-ups.

## Payments (Phase 3)
Do not include in MVP due to compliance complexity.
When added:
- Charge a platform fee (e.g., 1–3%) as an add-on module.
- Clearly state payment processor fees are separate.

## Go-to-market
- Start with 1–3 local leagues and make them “reference customers”.
- Offer first season discounted for case studies and feedback.
- Prioritise reliability and admin-time saved in messaging:
  - “Fixtures, reminders, results, tables — no spreadsheets.”

## ROI scenarios (illustrative)
Scenario 1: 25 leagues at Tier 1
- £3,725 / year

Scenario 2: 50 leagues at Tier 1 + 10 leagues at Tier 2
- (50*149) + (10*349) = £7,450 + £3,490 = £10,940 / year

Scenario 3: 100 leagues mix (70 Tier1, 25 Tier2, 5 Tier3)
- 70*149 = £10,430
- 25*349 = £8,725
- 5*649  = £3,245
Total = £22,400 / year

Add-ons (later) can materially improve margin:
- TV mode licence
- API access tier
- Sponsor banner module
- Payments module (take-rate)
