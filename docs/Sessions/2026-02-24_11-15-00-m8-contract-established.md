# Session Overview: Milestone 8 Contract Established

## Date
2026-02-24

## Scope
- Established the implementation contract for Milestone 8 before additional code changes.
- Defined API, web, refresh, sponsor-scope, and acceptance criteria expectations.

## Deliverable
- Added:
  - `docs/28-M8-TV-Overlay-Contract.md`

## Notes
- This was a planning/contract checkpoint only (no runtime feature code in this step).
- Contract became the reference used for subsequent Milestone 8 thin-slice implementation and hardening.
